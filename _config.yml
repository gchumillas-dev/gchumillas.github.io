  Hi! my name's Gonzalo and I worked for over ten years building websites and web applications, mainly in PHP, MySQL, jQuery and later in Angular and React. I have also offered technical support, such as the administration of Linux-based servers. I consider myself specially qualified for the <mark>analysis</mark>, <mark>development</mark> and <mark>design</mark> of applications and user interfaces.

  **<< It's important for me to note that I'm currently looking for remote jobs. >>**

  I already worked remotely for quite some years with very good results.

  Not everything is coding. I also like photography and exploring and capturing moments with my Ricoh GR II. Previously I had a Fuji X-T1, a fantastic camera, but it was a bit big for street photography.
