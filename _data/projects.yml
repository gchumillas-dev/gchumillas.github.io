    The project consists of two parts, one on the server side developed in PHP and MySQL and another on the client side developed in Angular and TypeScript. And its main virtue, apart from organizing your Dropbox photos, is to be able to include the same photo in several categories.

  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    PHPQuery was a library developed in PHP and originally inspired by jQuery. It was used in an ambitious private project and currently consists of a class through which we can create, manipulate and read XML documents in an easy and intuitive way. Among its features include the use of CSS as a query language.

    **Currently I'm still working on new projects and bookstores.<br>
    You will find more examples in my [GitHub](http://github.com/gchumillas) profile.**
