    The project consists of two parts, one on the server-side developed in PHP and MySQL and another one on the client-side developed in Angular and TypeScript. And its main virtue, apart from organizing your Dropbox photos, is the ability of including the same photo in different categories.

    A library developed in PHP and originally inspired by jQuery. It was used in an ambitious private project and currently consists of a class from which we can create, update and read XML documents in an easy and intuitive way. Furthermore, we can use CSS3 as a query language to parse DOM documents.

    **There are more projects and libraries in my [GitHub](http://github.com/gchumillas) account. Please take a look at it.**
