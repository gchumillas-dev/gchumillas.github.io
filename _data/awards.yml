    It is usual to have a main table and several secondary tables. And perform operations such as insertion, editing or reading on all those tables tends to be a cumbersome task. Through this library we can operate on all those tables at once, simplifying the source code.

    This library was used in a much more ambitious project for online content management.

And among its features it highlighted the possibility of embedding "enriched" texts with HTML tags. Through this library we can transform HTML for Flash into the HTML5 standard.
