    It's usual to have a main table and a list of secondary tables linked to it. And perform operations such as inserting, updating, reading or deleting over all those tables tends to be a little tricky. Thanks to this library we can perform such those operations at once, simplifying the source code.

    This library was used in a more ambitious project.
